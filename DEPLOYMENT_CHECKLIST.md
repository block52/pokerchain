- [ ] Verify binary size is reasonable

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Stop Remote Services
- [ ] SSH to node1.block52.xyz
- [ ] Stop pokerchaind systemd service: `sudo systemctl stop pokerchaind`
- [ ] Verify no pokerchaind processes running: `pgrep pokerchaind`
- [ ] Force kill if necessary: `sudo pkill -9 pokerchaind`

### 2. Backup Remote Data
- [ ] Create timestamped backup directory
- [ ] Copy existing `/root/.pokerchain` to backup
- [ ] Note backup location for rollback if needed

### 3. Clean Remote Installation
- [ ] Remove old binary: `sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/pokerchaind`
- [ ] Remove old data: `rm -rf /root/.pokerchain`

### 4. Upload New Binary
- [ ] SCP binary to remote: `scp ./build/pokerchaind root@node1.block52.xyz:/tmp/`
- [ ] Move to system location: `sudo mv /tmp/pokerchaind /usr/local/bin/pokerchaind`
- [ ] Set permissions: `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pokerchaind`
- [ ] Set ownership: `sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/pokerchaind`
- [ ] Verify remote binary version: `pokerchaind version`

### 5. Upload Configuration Files
- [ ] SCP genesis.json to remote
- [ ] SCP app.toml to remote
- [ ] SCP config.toml to remote
- [ ] SCP priv_validator_key.json to remote
- [ ] SCP priv_validator_state.json to remote

### 6. Initialize Remote Node
- [ ] Initialize pokerchaind: `pokerchaind init node1 --chain-id pokerchain --home /root/.pokerchain`
- [ ] Copy genesis.json to `/root/.pokerchain/config/`
- [ ] Copy app.toml to `/root/.pokerchain/config/`
- [ ] Copy config.toml to `/root/.pokerchain/config/`
- [ ] Copy priv_validator_key.json to `/root/.pokerchain/config/`
- [ ] Set validator key permissions: `chmod 600 /root/.pokerchain/config/priv_validator_key.json`
- [ ] Copy priv_validator_state.json to `/root/.pokerchain/data/`
- [ ] Set validator state permissions: `chmod 600 /root/.pokerchain/data/priv_validator_state.json`

### 7. Verify Configuration Integrity
- [ ] Compare genesis hash on remote: `sha256sum /root/.pokerchain/config/genesis.json`
- [ ] Expected hash: `e706ff48a598d50c3661e5215a3781484cf0b75c591b8024f3336683c9cdc553`
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Hashes must match exactly

### 8. Restore Persistent Keys (Optional)
- [ ] Check for backup node_key.json in backup directory
- [ ] If found, restore to maintain consistent node ID
- [ ] Set proper permissions: `chmod 600 /root/.pokerchain/config/node_key.json`

### 9. Start Service
- [ ] Start pokerchaind: `sudo systemctl start pokerchaind`
- [ ] Wait 3 seconds for initialization
- [ ] Check service status: `sudo systemctl status pokerchaind`

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Service Health Checks
- [ ] Verify service is active: `systemctl is-active pokerchaind`
- [ ] Check for errors in logs: `journalctl -u pokerchaind -n 100 --no-pager`
- [ ] Wait 5 seconds for RPC to be ready

### RPC Endpoint Checks
- [ ] Test RPC responds: `curl -s http://localhost:26657/status`
- [ ] Test RPC from external: `curl -s http://node1.block52.xyz:26657/status`
- [ ] Get node ID: `pokerchaind tendermint show-node-id --home /root/.pokerchain`
- [ ] Get validator address: `pokerchaind tendermint show-validator --home /root/.pokerchain`

### Block Production Verification
- [ ] Record initial block height from status
- [ ] Record initial block time
- [ ] Wait 30 seconds
- [ ] Query status again: `curl -s http://node1.block52.xyz:26657/status`
- [ ] Record new block height
- [ ] **Calculate blocks produced**: new_height - initial_height
- [ ] **Expected**: Should be > 0 (at least 1-3 blocks in 30 seconds)

### Validator Status
- [ ] Check validator list: `curl -s http://node1.block52.xyz:26657/validators`
- [ ] Verify our validator is in the active set
- [ ] Check voting power is non-zero
- [ ] Verify validator is signing blocks

---

## Troubleshooting: Blocks Not Being Mined

### Common Causes & Fixes

#### 1. Genesis Mismatch
- [ ] **Check**: Genesis hash on remote matches local
- [ ] **Symptom**: Node starts but can't sync, consensus fails
- [ ] **Fix**: Re-upload correct genesis.json

#### 2. Validator Not Active
- [ ] **Check**: Validator in active set: `curl http://localhost:26657/validators`
- [ ] **Symptom**: Node runs but doesn't produce blocks
- [ ] **Fix**: Ensure validator key is correct and has voting power

#### 3. Incorrect priv_validator_state.json
- [ ] **Check**: Validator state file has correct format
- [ ] **Symptom**: Double-sign protection or height mismatch errors
- [ ] **Fix**: Reset validator state or restore from backup

#### 4. Consensus Configuration Issues
- [ ] **Check**: config.toml consensus settings (timeout_commit, block time)
- [ ] **Symptom**: Slow or no block production
- [ ] **Fix**: Verify consensus parameters match network requirements

#### 5. Binary Version Mismatch
- [ ] **Check**: Binary version matches network requirements
- [ ] **Symptom**: Incompatible block format, consensus failures
- [ ] **Fix**: Build from correct git commit/tag

#### 6. Insufficient Voting Power
- [ ] **Check**: Query validator voting power
- [ ] **Symptom**: Node is validator but not proposing blocks
- [ ] **Fix**: Ensure validator has enough stake

#### 7. Port/Network Issues
- [ ] **Check**: P2P port 26656 accessible
- [ ] **Check**: Firewall rules allow consensus communication
- [ ] **Symptom**: Node isolated, can't connect to peers
- [ ] **Fix**: Open required ports, check network connectivity

## Notes & Observations

### Binary Information
- **Built version**: main-7a22c7ada02a1b7be6165f589f5761af9b3e9b16
- **Binary size**: 158M (Linux amd64 cross-compiled from macOS)
- **Genesis hash**: e706ff48a598d50c3661e5215a3781484cf0b75c591b8024f3336683c9cdc553 ✅ VERIFIED

### Deployment Results
- **Deployment date**: 2025-10-31 02:00:37 UTC
- **Initial block height**: 0 (height regression issue)
- **Block height after fix**: 10+ and counting
- **Blocks produced**: ~10 blocks in first 30 seconds after fix
- **Block production rate**: ~2 blocks per minute (~30 seconds per block)
- **Final status**: ✅ **SUCCESS - Blocks being produced**

### Issues Encountered
1. **SSH Connection Timeout** (Initial attempt)
   - Firewall blocking SSH port 22
   - Resolved by user (firewall rules updated)

2. **Binary Architecture Mismatch** (Critical)
   - Binary compiled for macOS (darwin) instead of Linux
   - Error: `cannot execute binary file: Exec format error`
   - Remote server is Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (x86_64)

3. **Validator Height Regression** (Critical - Blocks not mining)
   - Error: `error signing proposal: height regression. Got 1, last height 3`
   - Error: `error signing vote: height regression. Got 1, last height 3`
   - Validator state file had already signed blocks at height 3
   - Genesis was starting from height 0/1
   - Consensus could not proceed due to double-sign protection

### Resolution Steps Taken
1. **Fixed Binary Architecture**
   - Updated `deploy-master-node.sh` to cross-compile for Linux
   - Changed build commands from:
     ```bash
     go build -o "$BUILD_DIR/pokerchaind" ./cmd/pokerchaind
     ```
   - To:
     ```bash
     GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o "$BUILD_DIR/pokerchaind" ./cmd/pokerchaind
     ```
   - File: `/Users/alexmiller/projects/pvm_cosmos_under_one_roof/pokerchain/deploy-master-node.sh:36,51`

2. **Fixed Validator Height Regression**
   - Reset `priv_validator_state.json` from height 3 to height 0
   - Changed from:
     ```json
     {"height": "3", "round": 0, "step": 3, "signature": "...", "signbytes": "..."}
     ```
   - To:
     ```json
     {"height": "0", "round": 0, "step": 0}
     ```
   - File: `.testnets/validator0/data/priv_validator_state.json`
   - Copied to remote server and restarted pokerchaind service
   - **Result**: Consensus immediately started, blocks began producing

## Local Sync Node Setup

**Date**: 2025-10-31 12:19 PM
**Script**: `setup-local-sync-node.sh`
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS - Binary version mismatch**

### Setup Results
- [x] Binary built successfully (ARM/macOS native)
- [x] Genesis file from repository (hash: `e706ff48a598d50c3661e5215a3781484cf0b75c591b8024f3336683c9cdc553`)
- [x] Node initialized with moniker "local-sync"
- [x] Persistent peer configured: `08890a89197b2afd56b115e9b749cef7d4578c5c@node1.block52.xyz:26656`
- [x] Node connected to node1.block52.xyz
- [x] ~~Started syncing blocks 1-6~~ **Initial attempt**
- [x] ✅ **Binary version fixed - ready for retry**

### Binary Version Issue
```
Local binary:  main-57a7828b387da091a81042a13930563a74769711
Remote binary: main-7a22c7ada02a1b7be6165f589f5761af9b3e9b16
```

**Problem**: Different commit versions produce different AppHashes
**Error**: `wrong Block.Header.AppHash. Expected 81941719..., got 517C4B19...`

### Root Cause
The local Mac built the binary from a different git commit than the remote Linux node. Even though both use the same genesis file, **different code versions can produce different state transition results**, leading to AppHash mismatches during block validation.

### Resolution Applied ✅
Built local binary from the **exact same git commit** as node1:
1. ✅ Stashed uncommitted changes
2. ✅ Checked out commit: `7a22c7ada02a1b7be6165f589f5761af9b3e9b16`
3. ✅ Rebuilt pokerchaind with `make install`
4. ✅ Returned to main branch
5. ✅ Restored stashed changes
6. ✅ Updated script to auto-detect CPU architecture

**Binary version**: `HEAD-7a22c7ada02a1b7be6165f589f5761af9b3e9b16` ✅ (matches node1)

### How to Run Local Sync Node

```bash
# Stop current pokerchaind (Ctrl+C in terminal where it's running)

# Run setup script
./setup-local-sync-node.sh

# When prompted: "Do you want to rebuild it? (y/n):"
# Answer: y   ← This will rebuild for your local architecture
#         n   ← Use existing binary

# Press Enter to start syncing
```

**Script Features**:
- ✅ Auto-detects CPU architecture (ARM64 for M1/M2/M3, x86_64 for Intel)
- ✅ Builds native binary (no cross-compilation)
- ✅ Shows architecture info during build
- ✅ Interactive rebuild for testing code changes

### Sync Node Configuration
```
Home Dir:     ~/.pokerchain
Node ID:      07de55d36db36181fbe1529b2c9800a4a2fba39f
Chain ID:     pokerchain
Moniker:      local-sync
Mode:         Read-only sync node (not validator)
Peer:         08890a89197b2afd56b115e9b749cef7d4578c5c@node1.block52.xyz:26656
```

### Successfully Verified
- ✅ Genesis file from repository (no remote verification needed for dev)
- ✅ P2P connection established to node1
- ✅ Started block sync from genesis
- ✅ Bridge service initialized (Base Chain USDC monitoring)
- ✅ All Cosmos SDK modules initialized correctly

### Script Updates (Dev Mode)
- ✅ Removed SSH genesis download from node1 (faster dev setup)
- ✅ Uses local genesis.json from repository
- ✅ Skips remote hash verification (not needed for local dev)
- ✅ Binary version now matches node1: `HEAD-7a22c7ada02a1b7be6165f589f5761af9b3e9b16`

### Important: Architecture vs Code Version

**Architecture DOES NOT affect AppHash:**
- ✅ ARM64 (Mac M1/M2) binary from commit `7a22c7a` → Same AppHash
- ✅ x86_64 (Linux) binary from commit `7a22c7a` → Same AppHash
- ❌ ARM64 binary from commit `57a7828` (main) → **Different AppHash** ⚠️

**The Issue:**
- When you rebuild with `./setup-local-sync-node.sh` and answer 'y', it builds from your **current git branch**
- If you're on `main` branch (commit `57a7828`), it builds a newer version
- Even though it's ARM64, it produces different AppHash because **code is different**

**The Fix:**
Use the helper script to build from the matching commit:
```bash
./build-matching-node1.sh
```

This script:
1. Stashes your changes
2. Checks out commit `7a22c7a`
3. Builds binary for your architecture (ARM64)
4. Returns to your branch
5. Restores your changes

**Result:** Your ARM64 Mac binary will produce the **same AppHash** as node1's x86_64 Linux binary!
