-   **Total USDC Tokens**: 1,000
-   **All tokens properly distributed**: No inflation or minting needed initially

### Key Features

1. **Authentic Addresses**: All addresses derived from actual BIP39 seed phrases
2. **Clean Genesis**: No historical blockchain state or accumulated rewards
3. **Validator Ready**: Alice configured as genesis validator with sufficient bonded tokens
4. **Test Ready**: Each actor has transaction tokens available (2,000 stake each)
5. **USDC Support**: Bridge-ready with USDC token allocation

## Files Updated

-   `genesis.json` - Complete genesis file ready for deployment
-   `TEST_ACTORS.md` - Updated with correct Iris and Jack addresses
-   `config.yml` - Configured for multi-validator setup
-   `add_test_actors.sh` - Script for adding test actors to any fresh genesis

## Deployment Ready

The genesis file is validated and ready for deployment to node1.block52.xyz or any other node. All test actors can be imported using their seed phrases and will have immediate access to their allocated tokens.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy genesis.json to production node
2. Start the blockchain network
3. Import additional test actors as validators if desired
4. Begin poker game testing with all 10 actors

This genesis provides a robust foundation for development, testing, and demonstration of the Pokerchain poker functionality.
